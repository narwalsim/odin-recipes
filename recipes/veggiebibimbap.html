    <h3> Ingredients </h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 2 tablespoons sesame oil </li>
        <li> 1 cup carrot matchsticks</li>
        <li>  1 cup zucchini matchsticks</li>
        <li>½ (14 ounce) can bean sprouts, drained </li>
        <li> 6 ounces canned bamboo shoots, drained</li>
        <li> 1 (4.5 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained </li>
        <li> ⅛ teaspoon salt to taste </li>
        <li> 2 cups cooked and cooled rice </li>
        <li> ⅓ cup sliced green onions </li>
        <li> 2 tablespoons soy sauce </li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
        <li> 1 tablespoon butter </li>
        <li> 3 eggs </li>
        <li> 3 teaspoons sweet red chili sauce, or to taste </li>
    </ul>
    <h3> Directions </h3>
    <ol> 
        <li> Step One: Heat sesame oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir carrot 
             and zucchini in the hot oil until vegetables begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir in bean sprouts, bamboo shoots, and mushrooms. Cook and stir until carrots are tender,
             about 5 more minutes. Season to taste with salt and set vegetables aside.</li>
        <li> Step Two: Stir cooked rice, green onions, soy sauce, and black pepper in the same skillet until the rice is hot.
            In a separate skillet over medium heat, melt butter and gently fry eggs, 
            turning once, until the yolks are still slightly runny but the egg whites are firm, about 3 minutes per egg.</li>
        <li> Step Three: To serve, divide hot cooked rice mixture between 3 serving bowls and top each bowl with 1/3 
            of the vegetable mixture and a fried egg. Serve sweet red chili sauce on the side for mixing into bibimbap.</lo>
